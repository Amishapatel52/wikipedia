            <td>Hanuman (/ˈhʌnʊˌmɑːn/; Sanskrit: हनुमान्, IAST: Hanumān),
                [4]also known as Maruti, Bajrangabali, and Anjaneya,[5]
               is a deity in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deva_(Hinduism)" name="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>, revered as a divine vanara and a devoted companion of the deity Rama.
               Central to the Ramayana, Hanuman is celebrated for his unwavering devotion to Rama and is considered a chiranjivi.
               He is traditionally believed to be the spiritual offspring of the wind deity <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vayu" name="vayu">vayu</a>,
               who is said to have played a significant role in his birth.[6][7] 
               His tales are recounted not only in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramayana" name="Ramayana">Ramayana</a> but also in the Mahabharata and various Puranas.
               Devotional practices centered around Hanuman were not prominent in these texts or in early archaeological evidence.
            His theological significance and the cultivation of a devoted following emerged roughly a millennium after the Ramayana was composed,
            during the second millennium CE, coinciding with the advent of Islamic rule in the Indian subcontinent.
            Hanuman's abilities are partly attributed to his lineage from Vayu, 
            symbolizing a connection with both the physical and the cosmic elements.
            Figures from the Bhakti movement, such as Samarth Ramdas, 
            have portrayed Hanuman as an emblem of nationalism and defiance against oppression.
            According to Vaishnava tradition, the sage Madhvacharya posited that Vayu aids Vishnu in his earthly incarnations,
            a role akin to Hanuman's assistance to Rama.[11] In recent times, the veneration of Hanuman through iconography and
            temple worship has significantly increased.[12] He epitomizes the fusion of "strength, heroic initiative, and
            assertive excellence" with "loving, emotional devotion" to his lord Rama, embodying both Shakti and Bhakti.
            Subsequent literature has occasionally depicted him as the patron deity of martial arts, meditation, and scholarly pursuits.
            He is revered  as an exemplar of self-control, faith, and commitment to a cause, transcending his outward Vanara appearance.
            Traditionally, Hanuman is celebrated as a lifelong celibate,
            embodying the virtues of chastity.
            The meaning or origin of the word "Hanuman" is unclear. In the Hindu pantheon, deities typically have many synonymous names, each based on some noble characteristic, attribute, or reminder of a mythical deed achieved by that deity.[20] One interpretation of "Hanuman" is "one having a disfigured jaw". This version is supported by a Puranic legend wherein infant Hanuman mistakes the Sun for a fruit, heroically attempts to reach it, and is wounded in the jaw for his attempt by Indra the King of Gods.[20]

Hanuman combines two of the most cherished traits in the Hindu bhakti-shakti worship traditions: "heroic, strong, assertive excellence" and "loving, emotional devotion to personal God".[20]

<p>Vedic roots
    The earliest mention of a divine monkey is in hymn 10.86 of the Rigveda, dated to between 1500 and 1200 BCE. The twenty-three verses of the hymn are a metaphorical and riddle-filled legend. It is presented as a dialogue between multiple figures: the god <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indra" name="indra">indra</a>, his wife Indrani and an energetic monkey it refers to as Vrisakapi and his wife Kapi.[24][25][26] The hymn opens with Indrani complaining to Indra that some of the soma offerings for Indra have been allocated to the energetic and strong monkey, and the people are forgetting Indra. The king of the gods, Indra, responds by telling his wife that the living being (monkey) that bothers her is to be seen as a friend, and that they should make an effort to coexist peacefully. The hymn closes with all agreeing that they should come together in Indra's house and share the wealth of the offerings.

    —Valmiki's Ramayana'
    Sita's first meeting with Hanuman
    (Translator: Philip Lutgendorf)[27]
    Hanuman is mentioned in both the Hindu epics, Ramayana and Mahabharata.[28]
    
    Hanuman is mentioned in the Puranas.[29][30] The Shiva Purana mentions Hanuman as an avatar of Shiva; all other Puranas and scriptures clearly mention him as the spiritual son of Vayu or incarnation of Vayu or sometimes avatar of Rudra (which is also another name of Vayu).[30][31] Commonly, Hanuman is not related to Shiva in Vaishnava traditions but is known as Shiva's avatar or sun in Shaiva traditions.[32]
    
    Other mythologies, such as those found in South India, present Hanuman as a being who is the union of Shiva and Vishnu, or associated with the origin of Ayyappa.[14] The 17th century Odia work Rasavinoda by Dinakrishnadasa goes on to mention that the three gods – Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva – combined to take to the form of Hanuman.[3
    In Valmiki's Ramayana, estimated to have been composed before or in about the 3rd century BCE,[35] Hanuman is an important, creative figure as a simian helper and messenger for Rama. The character evolved over time, reflecting regional cultural values. It is, however, in the late medieval era that his profile evolves into more central role and dominance as the exemplary spiritual devotee, particularly with the popular vernacular text Ramcharitmanas by Tulsidas (~ 1575 CE).[22][36] According to scholars such as Patrick Peebles and others, during a period of religious turmoil and Islamic rule of the Indian subcontinent, the Bhakti movement and devotionalism-oriented Bhakti yoga had emerged as a major trend in Hindu culture by the 16th-century, and the Ramcharitmanas presented Rama as a Vishnu avatar, supreme being and a personal god worthy of devotion, with Hanuman as the ideal loving devotee with legendary courage, strength and powers.</p>
